    "Table  1.Optimization of electrochemical oxidative palladium-catalyzed carbonylation carbocyclization of enallenols.[a] [a] Unless otherwise noted the reaction was conducted in methanol solvent (10 mL) at room temperature using1a(0.2 mmol), BQ (20 mol %) and acetic acid (HOAc, 1.1 μL, 10 mol %) in the presence of Pd source (5 mol %), with LiClO4(2.0 equiv) as electrolyte, which generated a cell voltage of 0.9–1.3 V. [b] isolated yield. [c] HOAc (2.2 μL, 20 mol %) was used as additive. [d] Without HOAc. [e] LiClO4(4.0 equiv) as electrolyte. [f] Acetonitrile (10 mL) as solvent. [g] A mixture solvent of methanol and water (1 : 1,v/v). [h] N-Bu4NClO4(4.0 equiv) was used as electrolyte. [i] Without BQ, 70 % of starting material recovered. [j] Without power supply, BQ (1.1 equiv) was used as oxidant. [k] 2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone was used in place of BQ as ETM.",
