    "Table 1 Control experiments for the screening of reaction conditionsa [a] Reactions were carried out by using [M] precatalyst (5 mol%), ligand (20 mol%),1a(0.2 mmol), and2a(0.22 mmol) in solvent for 18 h at 100 °C under an N2atmosphere. [b] Isolated yield after purification of the product3aaby column chromatography. N. P.: No desired products.",
    "Table 2 Substrate scope for the intermolecular cross-coupling of 2-iodophenols1and silacyclobutanes2to access 7-membered silacyclesa [a] Reaction conditions: Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2(5 mol%),tBuDavePhos (20 mol%), NEt3(0.08 mmol), pempidine (0.32 mmol), CH3CN/DMF (1 mL; 10/1), 100 °C, 18 h. Values represent isolated yields. [b] The reaction was performed in the presence of 2-iodophenol1(0.22 mmol), silacyclobutane2(0.2 mmol), Pd(MeCN)2Cl2(2.6 mg, 5 mol%) andtBuDavePhos (13.6 mg, 20 mol%) in DMF (91 μL) and MeCN (0.91 mL) at 100 °C under N2for 8 h. Then additional Pd(MeCN)2Cl2(2.6 mg, 5 mol%) was added to the reaction and heated for another 10 h. For more experimental details, see ESI."
