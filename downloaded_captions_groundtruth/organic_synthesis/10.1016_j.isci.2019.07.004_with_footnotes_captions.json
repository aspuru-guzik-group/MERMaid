    "Table 3. Substrate Scope Study for Ni-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Cyclic Sulfamidate Imines Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were carried out with a Ni(OAc) 2 /( S , S )-Ph-BPE/substrate 1 (0.1 mmol) ratio of 1:1.1:100 in 1.0 mL CF 3 CH 2 OH under 60 atm H 2 at 80°C for 24 h. Conversion was determined by 1 H NMR analysis. Yield is isolated yield. The ee value was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography on a chiral column."
