    "Figure 1. Mechanistic studies. (a, left) Time-dependent UV–vis spectra of MB+(2a, 0.015 mM) in a CTAB solution of TMEDA (1.5 mM) upon irradiation (455 nm) over 20 min. (a, right) UV–vis spectra of MB+(2a), leuco MB (2b), and leuco azure B (2d). Forms2band2dwere generated upon irradiation (455 nm) over 10 min. Legend: (a) in the presence of TMEDA (1.5 mM) in CTABaq(50 mM); (b) in the presence ofn-BuNH2(1.5 mM) in SDSaq(50 mM); (c) in the presence of Na2S2O4(1.5 mM) in CTABaq(50 mM). (b) Transformations of methylene blue (2a) in the presence of amines. (c) Substrate1atreated with leuco-form2bor2din darkness. (d) Reactions ofN-cyclic benzamides7aand10a. (e) Proposed mechanism. PC denotes the photocatalyst: methylene blue (2a) or azure B (2c). LPC denotes leuco-form2bor2dinteracting with an amine. (f) Computed pathway of the dealkylation mechanism ofCmediated by the presence ofn-BuNH2. All energies reported are Gibbs free energies (in kcal mol–1) obtained at the PW6B95-D3BJ/def2-QZVP//r2SCAN-3c level of theory.",
