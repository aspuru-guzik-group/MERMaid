(a, right) UV -vis spectre of MB (2a), leuco MB (b), and leucos azure B (2d), Forms 2b and 2d weregenerated upon irradiation (45 nm)over 10 min. Legend: (a) in the presence of TMEIDA (1s ml(m) in CTAB, (50 ml(M), (c) in presence of Na2S0, (1S mlM) in CTAB, (so mml(m), (b) Transformations of methylene blue(a), in the Presence of amines.(c) Substrate la treated with leuco-form 2b or 2d in darkness.(d) Reactions of N-cyclic benzamides 7a and 10a.(e) Proposed mechanism. PC denotes the photocatalyst: methylylene blue (a), or azureB (2c), LPC denotes leucose-form 20b or2d interacting withan amino. (f) Computated pathway of the dealkylation mechanism of C mediated by the presence of n-BuNH, All energies reported are Gibbs freeenergies (in kcal mol) obtained at the PW6895-D3B/d2e2-QZVP/fSCAN-3c level of theory",
