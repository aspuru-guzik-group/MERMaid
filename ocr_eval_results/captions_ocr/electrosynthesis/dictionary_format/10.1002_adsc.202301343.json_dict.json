    "Scheme 2": "Scope of the 1.3-oxoxydoxyvalation of arylcyclopropanes.Reaction conditions: carbon cloth anode; Pt plate cathode,constant current =20mA, cyclopropane (02.nmol), Bu.NCIO, 0.2 nmol), H.O(1.0 mL), HPF (0.4 mL), CH.COCH, (5.5 mL),50\u2103, undivided cell under Ar. Isolated yields were shown.1\u00ba HO (1.1 mL), HOAC (02mL), CHCOCH (57 mL), were used.2\u00ba H2O (01mL), HOAc (02ml), CHCOOCH (67 mL), Bu,NBF, (02mmol) were used.(H2O) (01 mL), HFP (04 mL),CH.COACH, (55 mL), DDQ (004 mL), Were used. Note: Solid (Bu,NCIO), poses a risk of explosion. Exercise extreme caution inhandling the solid",
