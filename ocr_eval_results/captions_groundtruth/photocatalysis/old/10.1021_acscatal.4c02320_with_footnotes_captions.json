    "Figure 1. Previous work on: a) hydroalkylation of electron-deficient alkenes viaTBADTphotocatalysis; b) photoelectrochemicalbis-heteroatomic functionalization of styrenes through single electron oxidation. This strategy focuses on: c) carboamidation of styrenes with unactivated hydrocarbons through tandem photoinduced HAT, radical addition, oxidative radical polar crossover, and Ritter-type amidation.",
