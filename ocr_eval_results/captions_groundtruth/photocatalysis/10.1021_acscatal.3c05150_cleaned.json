(C) Quenching of emission with various substrates (40 mM). Addition of collidine (10 mM) does not enhance the quenching (only an additive effect and not cooperative). (D) Fraction of quenching efficiency of Fukuzumi catalyst emission with two different substrates (40 mM), calculated as 1 -IquencherI0, whereIquencherandI0are the emission intensities in presence and absence of quencher, respectively. The inset shows the different areas of contribution of the acridinium and charge transfer states to the fluorescence spectrum of the Fukuzumi catalyst. (E) Transient absorption spectra with the model alcohol substrate (1o) (40 mM) at 300 ns after laser excitation at 430 nm. (F) Transient absorption spectra with 4-methylanisole (40 mM) at 100 ns after laser excitation at 430 nm. (G) Transient absorption spectra with the model alcohol substrate (1n) (50 mM)",
