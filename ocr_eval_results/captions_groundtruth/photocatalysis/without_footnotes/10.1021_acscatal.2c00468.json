Legend: (a) in the presence of TMEDA (1.5 mM) in CTABaq(50 mM); (b) in the presence ofn-BuNH2(1.5 mM) in SDSaq(50 mM); (c) in the presence of Na2S2O4(1.5 mM) in CTABaq(50 mM). (b) Transformations of methylene blue (2a) in the presence of amines. (c) Substrate1atreated with leuco-form2bor2din darkness. (d) Reactions ofN-cyclic benzamides7aand10a. (e) Proposed mechanism. PC denotes the photocatalyst: methylene blue (2a) or azure B (2c). LPC denotes leuco-form2bor2dinteracting with an amine. (f) Computed pathway of the dealkylation mechanism ofCmediated by the presence ofn-BuNH2.
