    "Figure 1": "Three typical paths of Ru(bpy)32+photocatalysis and the new photocatalytic model of this work. In the new addition\u2013elimination model, the photocatalyst (i.e., I2) at its excited state and the substrate react to form an intermediate (iodination), and at the final stage of the cascade reactions the photodeiodination reaction gives the desired product and the regenerated photocatalyst. The abbreviations are Sub = substrate, RQ = reductive quencher, and OQ = oxidative quencher",
