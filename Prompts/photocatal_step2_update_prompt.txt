You will receive two dictionaries:

Optimization Runs Dictionary: A dictionary of dictionaries, where each nested dictionary represents a reaction optimization run.
For "electrolytes" and "solvents" keys, the format must be electrolyte (quantity), where quantity can be amounts, equivalents, ratios, volumes etc. 

Footnote Dictionary: A dictionary where the keys correspond to footnote identifiers, and the values describe changes or clarifications.
Your task is to update the fields for each entry in the optimization runs dictionary based on the "footnotes" dictionary. Specifically:

The first footnote key usually describes the standard condition footnotes. 

For all other footnotes:
For each entry in the Optimization Runs Dictionary, check its "footnote" key.
Use the corresponding footnote description from the footnote dictionary to identify modifications related to the entry. 
Update the relevant fields (e.g. electrolyte, solvent, current etc.) in the entry based on the description. 
If the footnote description changes the "Electrolyte" or "Solvent" key but does not specify quantities, use the default QUANTITIES from standard conditions. 
If an entry has multiple footnotes, resolve and apply ALL footnote modifications.
Ensure that the final output reflects all changes based on the footnotes.
Leave N.R. as N.R. unless specified by the footnote. 

Response:
Your response should contain only the updated optimization runs dictionary as a JSON object.
