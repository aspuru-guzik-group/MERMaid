You will receive several images. Your goal is to extract and structure detailed information on different reaction conditions, ensuring that all specified modifications are applied correctly. Identify the standard conditions provided explicitly either in the first footnote or in the reaction diagram. ONLY use information found in these two sources.  

Your task is to generate a JSON object structured as follows:

Optimization Runs Dictionary: 
This is a dictionary of dictionaries, where each entry represents an optimization run. For each run, begin by using the standard conditions. You MUST modify the conditions where specific changes are indicated in each entry, REPLACING with the correct conditions. Each run should contain the following key-value pairs:

"Entry": Entry number for the run.
"Anode": Anode material (positive end). Use abbreviations if available. NOTE: the anode and cathode may be separated by delimiters such as |, /, //, or ||, with or without space. the anode usually appears before the delimiter. Pay particular attention to SEPARATE before including as anode or cathode. There MUST be NO delimiters in the final output. If no polarity indications or delimiters are used, assume the material is used for both the anode and cathode.
"Cathode": Cathode material (negative end). Use abbreviations if available. Cathode usually appears after the delimiter.
"Electrolytes": Include ALL NON-SOLVENT chemicals, such as electrolytes, additives, bases, acids, mediators etc, separated by commas if there are multiple. You MUST use chemical (quantity) format, where quantity can refer to amounts, equivalents (eq., equiv.), and concentrations, whichever are present. you MUST assume quantitative values and UNITS from standard conditions when the chemical changes but explicit quantitative values are not provided.
"Solvents": Specify ALL SOLVENTS and COSOLVENTS used. You MUST use chemical (quantity with UNITS) format, where quantity can refer to volumes, ratios etc. You must assume quantitative values and units from standard conditions when explicit quantitative values are not provided.
"Footnote": A string representing all superscript notations associated with the run, separated by commas if there are multiple. Superscript notations may appear in any columns. Use empty string if no superscript.
Footnotes Dictionary: 
This dictionary stores footnotes, where each superscript notation is a key, and its full explanation is the value. For missing explanation, put N.R.

Important Rules: 
For any runs missing specific details, assume the values from the standard conditions unless otherwise specified. 
For any missing information and empty cells, use "N.R." (Not Reported).
Each material or compound should only appear once in each dictionary.
Please provide a complete list of all entries, even if the list is long. 
Internal standard MUST NOT be included. 
Assume changes SUBSTITUTE the standard condition unless otherwise specified that it is an addition. 
MAKE SURE ALL CHEMICALS are included. 
If any COLUMN INFORMATION is not included in previous fields, you MUST add to 'OTHERS'.
