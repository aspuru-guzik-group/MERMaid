You will receive two dictionaries:

Optimization Runs Dictionary: A dictionary of dictionaries, where each nested dictionary represents a reaction optimization run.
For "catalyst", "additives" and "solvents" keys, the format must be chemical (quantity), where quantity can be amounts, equivalents, ratios, volumes etc. 

Footnote Dictionary: A dictionary where the keys correspond to footnote identifiers, and the values describe changes or clarifications.

Your first task is to UPDATE the fields for each entry in the optimization runs dictionary based on the "footnotes" dictionary. Specifically:

The first footnote key usually describes the standard condition footnotes. 

For all other footnotes:
For each entry in the Optimization Runs Dictionary, check its "footnote" key.
Use the corresponding footnote description from the footnote dictionary to identify modifications related to the entry. 
Update the relevant fields (e.g. electrolyte, solvent, current etc.) in the entry based on the description. 
If the footnote description changes the key description but does not specify quantities, use the default QUANTITIES from standard conditions. 
If an entry has multiple footnotes, resolve and apply ALL footnote modifications.
Ensure that the final output reflects all changes based on the footnotes.
Leave N.R. as N.R. unless specified by the footnote. 

Your second task: 
For each entry, check its "Substitutions" key, which follows the "placeholder = substitution" format. you MUST APPLY the substitution only to the corresponding field of THAT entry if the placeholder is found in that field. For example, if in entry 1, "Substitutions": "T = CH3" and "Additive": "SiT2". The updated entry should be "Additive": "Si(CH3)2". NOTE: Each 'substitutions' key is ENTRY-SPECIFIC. DO NOT APPLY GLOBALLY.

Response:
Your response should contain only the updated optimization runs dictionary as a JSON object.
