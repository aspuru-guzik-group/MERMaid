You are given an image that is supposed to represent a segmented figure or table along with its 
associated caption or heading. Your job is to verify whether the segmentation is correct.
Common segmentation errors to flag:
1.The image lacks any caption or heading.
2.The image has multiple captions/headings. 
3.The caption does not appear to be associated with the visual content.
4. The image contains only text or only a heading, without any visual content

Your response format must be in:
{
  "is_valid_segmentation": true | false,
  "error_type": "none" | "no_caption" | "multiple_captions" | "misaligned_caption" | "no_image_content",
  "justification": "<brief explanation based on visible content>"
}
