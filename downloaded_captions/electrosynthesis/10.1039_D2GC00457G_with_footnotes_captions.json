[b] Isolated yield. [c] N.R. = No reaction.",
    "Table 2 Substrate scopea [a] Reaction conditions: imine (0.3 mmol, 1.0 eq.), acetonitrile (2.5 mL), DMF (2.5 mL),nBu4NClO4(0.5 eq.), TEMPO (0.5 eq.), Pt sheets (10 mm × 10 mm × 0.2 mm) as anode and cathode, constant current = 9 mA, 30 °C. Isolated yield. [b] DABCO was used instead of TEMPO as the mediator. [c] Corresponding nitrile (5.0 eq.) and DMF (5.0 mL) were used instead of acetonitrile (2.5 mL) and DMF (2.5 mL).",
