Using a 0.071 cm2glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode and a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.1 V s−1scan rate, −0.25 to 1.9 V (background-grey dashed line): LiClO4(0.1 M), (KBr-green line): KBr (1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M), (8, blue line):8(1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M), (KBr +8, black dotted line): KBr (1 mM),8(1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M). (B) Same asA, 0.1 V s−1scan rate, 0.25 to −2 V. (C) Cyclic voltammogram of8in MeCN–H2O (5:1) with LiClO4(0.1 M) using a glassy carbon electrode as both the working electrode and counter/reference electrode. 0.1 V s−1scan rate, −0.25 to 3.0 V (background-grey dashed line): LiClO4(0.1 M), (KBr-green line): KBr (1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M), (8, blue line):8(1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M), (KBr +8, black dotted line): KBr (1 mM),8(1 mM), LiClO4(0.1 M).
