    "Table 1 Initial screening of CDC reaction between 1,4-dioxane and indole1aa [a] Reaction conditions:1a(0.5 mmol),2a(2 mL), [Cat.] (10% mol) and oxidant (0.75 mmol) were stirred at 140 °C in air for 20 hours. (DTBP = di-tert-butyl peroxide, TBPB =tert-butylperoxybenzoate, TBHP =tert-butyl hydroperoxide (70% in aqueous solution), BPO = benzoyl peroxide.) [b] Isolated yield. [c] Under a nitrogen atmosphere. [d] 120 °C was used. [e] 1 mL of2awas used.",
    "Table 2 Cross-dehydrogenative-coupling reaction of 1,4-dioxane with various indolesa [a] Reaction conditions: substituted indoles1a–1p(0.5 mmol), 1,4-dioxane (2a) (2 mL), and DTBP (0.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) were stirred at 140 °C under N2for 20 hours. Isolated yields are reported. Reaction times are not optimized for each substrate.",
    "Table 3 Cross-dehydrogenative-coupling reaction of indoles with various ethers and cycloalkanesa [a] Reaction conditions: substituted indole1aor1o(0.5 mmol), ether or cycloalkane2a–j(2 mL), and DTBP (0.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) were stirred at 140 °C under N2for 20 hours. Isolated yields are reported. Reaction times are not optimized for each substrate. [b] 2.0 mmol of DTBP was used. [c] 5 equivalents of1jwere used with 2 mL of xylene as a solvent."
