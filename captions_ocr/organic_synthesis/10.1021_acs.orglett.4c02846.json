    "ABSTRACT: Tight chelation of enolate by lithium alters theselectivity of tandem palladium-catalyzed cyclization/coupling ofterminal a-homopropargyl-b-ketoesters with aryl halides. In thepresence of LiOH, substituted cyclopentenes are preferentiallyformed via S-endo-dig carbocyclization, in contrast to the 6-exo-digoxocylization exclusively observed in the absence of a hard,chelating metal center. The disclosed transformation, featuringmild conditions and broad functional group tolerance, can beapplied for a variety of (hetero)aryl bromides as well as aryl andvinyl trilates.",
