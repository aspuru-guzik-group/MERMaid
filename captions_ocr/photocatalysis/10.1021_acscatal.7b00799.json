    "Figure 1. Three typical paths of Ru(bpy)3 2+ photocatalysis and thenew photocatalytic model of this work. In the new addition-elimination model, the photocatalyst (i.e., I2) at its excited state andthe substrate react to form an intermediate (iodination), and at thefinal stage of the cascade reactions the photodeiodination reactiongives the desired product and the regenerated photocatalalyst. Theabbreviations are Sub = substrate, RQ = reductive quencher, and QQ= oxidative quenchers.",
