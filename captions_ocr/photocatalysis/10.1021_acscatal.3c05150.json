(C)Quenching of emission with various substrates (40 ml/mL). Addition of collitine (10 ml/ml) does not enhance the quenching (only an additive effectand not cooperative). (D) Fraction of quenchering efficiency of Fukuzumi catalyst emission with two different substrates(40 mL/mL), calculated as 1-quencher/A) where, and I, are the emission intensities in presence and absence of quenchcher, respectively. The insert shows the different areas ofcontribution of the acididium and charge transfer states to the fluorescence spectrum of the Fukuzumi catalyst.
